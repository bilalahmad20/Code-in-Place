# Code-in-Place
Final Project
This program uses statistical analysis to recommend IBS BFSU elective courses for the user based on their interests;
reads in the answers from the user, and then uses Pearson's R value to calculate the correlation of different courses
based on the data previously collected; ends with when the user has got the recommendations.
